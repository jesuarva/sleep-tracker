# Sleep Tracker App

A personal exercise

## Run in local development

Set your Node version to v14.15.1

To start the backend, open a terminal window and run:

```bash
cd backend/
npm i
npm start
```

To start the frontend, open a new terminal window and run:

```bash
cd frontend/
npm i
npm start
```

Then, in a browser window navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

Enjoy! ðŸ’¤ ðŸŒ™

# TODOS

These are some things I would like to have implemented but couldn't as I run out of time:

- Implement test
- Implement the BE in TypeScript
- Polish FE styles
- Abstract and make reusable some duplicated code
- Handle API request errors
- Improve Form's submit button states (disable/enabled)
